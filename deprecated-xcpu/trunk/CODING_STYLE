CODING STYLE

Plan 9 C code has its own conventions. You would do well to follow them:

no expanded tabs
no white space before opening braces.
no white space after the word "if", "for", "while", etc.
no braces around single-line blocks (e.g., if, for, and while bodies).
integer-valued functions return -1 on error, 0 or positive on success.
functions that return errors should set errstr(2).
variable and function names are all lowercase, with no underscores.
enum or #defined constants should be Uppercase or UPPERCASE.
struct tags are Uppercase, with matching typedefs.
automatic variables (local variables inside a function) are never  initialized at declaration.
follow the standard idioms: use x<0 not 0>x, etc.

Ultimately, the goal is to write code that fits in with the other code
around it and the system as a whole. If the file you are editing
already deviates from these guidelines, do what it does. After you
edit a file, a reader should not be able to tell just from coding
style which parts you worked on.
