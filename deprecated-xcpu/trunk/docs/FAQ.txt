Q: What is Xcpu?

Q: What additional software is required with Xcpu?

Q: How do I download and stay up to date with Xcpu?
A: Download using subversion (a cvs replacement) from out xcpu.org
repository:

svn svn://xcpu.org/xcpu/trunk xcpu

Q: How do I compile Xcpu?

    cd xcpu
    ./INSTALL # only if you don't have p9p, if you do then it'll just use
              # whatever $PLAN9 is defined to, so skip this step
    mk
    mk install # puts everything in $PLAN9/bin

Q: How do I run Xcpu?
A: Run a server listening on localhost, port 20001:

    xsrv 'tcp!127.0.0.1!20001'

run a server listening to all networks, port 20001:

    xsrv 'tcp!*!20001'

run a single client (connecting directly over 9p):

    9rx 127.1 /bin/date

mount xsrv:

    modprobe 9p2000
    for i in `seq 1 10`; do mkdir -p /mnt/xcpu/$i/xcpu; done
    mount -t 9P -o port=20001 127.0.0.1 /mnt/xcpu/1/xcpu
    rx 1 /bin/date

rx takes a regular expression for the list of nodes to run the command on,
while 9rx takes a list of comma separated P9 dial strings:

    # mount the same server 10 times
    for i in `seq 1 10`; do mount -t 9P -o port=20001 127.0.0.1
    /mnt/xcpu/$i/xcpu; done
    # run date on 9 of the 10 nodes
    rx [1-9] /bin/date

    # run date with -n on the same xcpu server twice, over 9p, show GMT
    9rx 127.1,127.1 /bin/date -u

if you have 'rx' on your system already (some linux distributions come with
an useless outdated command called rx) just use ./o.rx instead from the
main xcpu directory

Q: How do I specify binaries for different architectures?
A: If you don't specify a binary starting with / then it'll cat the 'uname'
file on the remote node and try to pick up a binary from `cat uname`/binary.
for example, for linux, on x86_64, you can do "rx 1 bin/date", then it
contacts the remote xcpu server, reads 'uname' which outputs /Linux/x86_64
and tries to copy over a file from /Linux/x86_64/bin/date. this allows you
to run different binaries on different systems at the same time.

Q: How do I quote spaces in my commands
