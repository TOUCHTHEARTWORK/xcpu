.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxbootfs\fP transfers files in a manner that is very scalable. It is inteaded
to be used for transfering boot images to all of the nodes in a cluster at once.  However, it can be used for transfering any file to a large number
of machines at once.


\fBxbootfs\fP uses the 9P file system which uses a client/server model to distribute the file.


There is always one main master server that must be started before any of the clients.
\fBxbootfs\fP turns 
some clients into servers for a period of time in order to distribute the load of the master server.

\fB-D\fP \fIlevel\fP
Turns on debugging messages.  Different information will be printed depending of the value of \fIlevel\fP.  If \fIlevel\fP is 1, xbootfs will print out function call debugging information.  If \fIlevel\fP is 2, xbootfs will print out 9P debugging information when acting as a server.  If \fIlevel\fP is 4, xbootfs will printout 9P debugging information when acting as a client.

This command will start a client with a \fIservicetime\fP of 30 seconds and save the downloaded file to /tmp/dboot.gz.
This command assumes the master server has an ip address of 10.0.0.1.
