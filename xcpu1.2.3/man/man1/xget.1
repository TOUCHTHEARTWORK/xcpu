.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxget\fP transfers files in a manner that is very scalable. It is inteaded to be used for 
transfering boot images to all of the nodes in a cluster at once.
However, it can be used for transfering any file to a large number of machines at once.
.PP
\fBxget\fP uses the 9P file system which and uses the client/server model to distribute the file.
.TP
\fBxget\fP is first executed as a master server that is be started before any of the clients. \fBxget\fP turns some clients into servers for a period of time in order to distribute the load of the master server.

.SH EXAMPLE
This command will start the master server so that it will serve all files in /tmp/src.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                       $ xget /tmp/src

.fam T
.fi
This command will start a client with a \fIservicetime\fP of 30 seconds and save all the files served from the server to /tmp/dest.  This  command assumes the master server has an ip address of 10.0.0.1.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                       $ xget \-s 30 -n 10.0.0.1 . /tmp/dest
