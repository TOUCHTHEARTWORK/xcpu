\section{Conclusions}

% recap
As cluster computing becomes more and more of a mainstream environment, it
is critical that we develop tools which maximize its potential by seamlessly
integrating distributed resources with the end-user's desktop environment.
By providing computation on demand we can create a more efficient and effective
work environment for solving academic, commercial and high-performance 
computing problems.
In this paper we have discussed the ongoing evolution of the Xcpu2 
framework for enabling this model of computation offload for application
acceleration.  We describe how it addresses shortcomings of its predecessor,
and lay out ideas for its future development.
Xcpu2 continues to evolve, we encourage you to try it for yourself and
participate in its development.  The current version is open source and
available along with its Xcpu predecessor at http://xcpu.org.
